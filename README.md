# TujenAutomation

This is purely academic, the idea is to automate a minigame inside Path of Exile, where you need to haggle certain items for artifacts.
For the recognition it is manually added in the inventory's first slot, with its value in chaos, the artifacts have a minimum threshold to be used.

Using opencv to match the currencies on the haggle board and pyautogui to automate the buying process
